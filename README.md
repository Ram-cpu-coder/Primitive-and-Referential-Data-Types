Today, I learnt the data types used in JavaScript.

There are two types of data types.
They are: 
1. Primitive Data Types
2. Referential Data Types

Primitive Data Types are those which is stored in a slack and are single values.
They are immutable. They are compared by values.
Examples: 
1. String
2. number
3. boolean
4. null
5. undefined


Null: Null takes the space in memory without the value.
Undefined is given to the system.


Referential Data Types are those which can be changed after creating and they are stored in heaps.
They are compared by the reference.
Examples:
1. objects
2. arrays
3. functions

Objects are the list of the values with the attributes.
